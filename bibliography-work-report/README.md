# Unofficial LaTeX template for reports/books/thesis with corporate logos of Universidad de Zaragoza with a beautiful look & feel

This two LaTeX projects have built-in bibiography in three different flavours:

- **bibunit-latex-template-report-university**: Uses package bibunits to show bibliography used only in each chapter as a section, it only shows the bibliography cites used as a section at the end of the chapter (Recommended).

- **chapterbib-latex-template-report-university-master**: Uses package chapterbib to show the bibliography used in all chapters as a section. It replicates all bibliography at the end of each chapter as a new section (NOT RECOMMENDED).

- **multibib-bibliography-subsection**: Uses multibib package and the default bibliography style, this project shows how to add subsections in the bibliography.
